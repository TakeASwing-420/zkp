# Expression Breakdown: `out = x⁴ - 5y²x²`

This project provides a step-by-step breakdown of the expression `out = x⁴ - 5y²x²` into intermediate variables.

## Expression

The expression we want to break down is:
 `out = x⁴ - 5y²x²`

## Breakdown

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

>v1 = x * x <br>
>v2 = v1 * v1 <br>
>v3 = -5y * y <br>
>-v2 + out = v3*v1 <br>
