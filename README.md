## Introduction to Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) allow one party to prove to another that they know a value, without revealing the value itself. This powerful cryptographic tool has many applications in privacy-preserving technologies, such as secure voting, private transactions, and identity verification.

## Basic Concepts and Terminology

Before diving into ZKPs, it's important to understand the key concepts and terminology used in the field. Here, you'll find explanations of terms like **completeness**, **soundness**, **zero-knowledge**, and more.

## Mathematical Foundations

ZKPs are built on a foundation of mathematical principles. This section covers the essential mathematical concepts you'll need to grasp, such as **modular arithmetic**, **elliptic curves**, and **polynomial commitments**.

## Popular ZK Protocols

Explore various ZK protocols, such as **zk-SNARKs**, **zk-STARKs**, **Bulletproofs**, and **Groth16**. Learn how these protocols work, their trade-offs, and where they are used.

## Practical Implementations

Get hands-on with implementing ZKPs using popular libraries and tools. This section includes tutorials and code examples in languages like Python, Rust, and Solidity.

## Advanced Topics

For those looking to go beyond the basics, this section covers advanced topics such as **recursive proofs**, **Verkle trees**, and **ZK-friendly hash functions**.
